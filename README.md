The goal of this challenge for Transilien SNCF Voyageurs is to have you predict, in the short term, the waiting time for a train located two stations upstream.
To evaluate the performance of your algorithm, we propose predicting the difference between the theoretical waiting time and the actual waiting time at each station over several days..
